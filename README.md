Four in a Row Game
===================

A custom four-in-a-row game that has been implemented using Python and is displayed on GUI.

The game is designed for two players, and consists of a board with 6 rows and 7 columns. 
Player's A disc is a round picture of Daenerys from Game of Thrones and player's B disc is 
a round picture of John Snow from Game of Thrones.

During their turn, players must choose a column into which they insert their disc, which 
lands at the top of the stack in that column or at the bottom of a new column.

The game ends when a player creates a sequence of four discs in any direction - vertical, 
horizontal, or diagonal. After the game ends, the player is prompted to start a new game or quit.

There are four possible game modes: Human vs. Human, Human vs. Computer, Computer vs. Human, 
and Computer vs. Computer. In Computer vs. Human and Computer vs. Computer games, the computer 
randomly selects a column.

The game is implemented in Python using Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP) design and utilizes 
the tkinter library for the GUI.
