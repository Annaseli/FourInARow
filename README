==================
=  Description:  =
This project is about building a game of 4 in a row, by using GUI with tkinter library.
We created file called ex12, that includes all of the pictures that are displayed in the
gui game.
We created file inside ex12 of game that includes the logic of the game, but displays nothing.
We created file inside ex12 of ai that includes a function of random move of ai.
We created file called four_in_a_row that includes the whole gui game.
It has 3 classes each for a different window.
The first window is a menu window that opens first. It leads to the second window, that
displays to the user which kind of game he chose to play: Human vs. Human, Human vs. Computer,
Computer vs. Human and Computer vs. Computer.
It leads to the final window which is the game. It includes a board, pictures that represent
players, status of the game and quit button.
At the end of the game it asks for play again. If the answer is yes, it leads to the
first window of menu.
